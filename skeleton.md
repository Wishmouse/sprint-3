--- What happens to the layout when you resize the screen to less than 550 px. How do you think that works? ---
When a screen is less than 550px instead of the text and images shrinking to fit on the page, which would make the pag impossible to read.  Instead the cells containing text and images stack on top of each other. Using stacked cells, more of the vertical screen is used, and the browser does not have to zoom out to make all the content fit.

When the screen starts shrinking or if opened on a device with a screen smaller than 550px. A defined rule will tell the browser to display specific cells below each other instead of next to each other.  the paces where these rulese are applied are called breakpoints
